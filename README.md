# SQL Skills Log

This repository serves as a personal learning log for my journey through the "Associate Data Engineer in SQL" career track from DataCamp. My goal is to actively reinforce my understanding of core data engineering concepts by taking my own notes and creating practical code examples.

### Content & Topics Covered

The contents of this repository cover the core topics from the career track, organized into logical units:

* **Unit 1: SQL Fundamentals**

I will be adding my personal notes and solutions to exercises in this space.

### Project Structure

The project is structured to separate learning notes from practical applications for each unit:

* **`1_SQL_Fundamentals/`**
    * `notes.sql`: Contains my personal notes and code examples for each topic, serving as a comprehensive study guide.
    * `exercises/`: This directory houses my solutions to exercises and small practice applications.
